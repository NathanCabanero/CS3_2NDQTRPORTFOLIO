      <h1>3.5 Musketeer's CR Decks</h1>
      <p>
      <b> In this project you can see the different decks that me and my friends use in the game of Clash Royale. Our deck's differences show the variety of play styles, likings, and approaches we have to the game in order for us to win. Despite the difference in decks, we are connected by our love for the game that lets us make our own deck the way we want it to be making the game enjoyable </b>

      <h2>Napc's Deck</h2>
      <p>
      <b> In this page you can see my favorite deck to use. This is a famous deck called the 2.6 hog cycle deck. I find this deck fun to use and it is a very helpful deck in terms of defending, its not easy at first to learn this popular deck but once learned it is very versatile against other types of decks. This deck has helped me get through many arenas and I have learned different strategies with it that compliments with my personal play style. </b>

     <b>   *Although it's important to have a main deck in order to climb through arenas, it's also just as important to try, expirement, and learn new decks. This is because some decks may not work as well in higher arenas as you earn new cards giving you oppurtunities to try new things. Another reason is that learning the more meta decks can help you understand how to counter them when you face opponents who use them. Decks also become out of meta, meaning that they are not as good anymore for reasons such as, there is already many ways to counter these decks, or because the games continuously adds new cards or nerfs/buffs which affects these decks </b>
